#  ctray - Handmade Hero's overlay timer

##  This branch of ctray

This branch of ctray is a unmodified copy of the code that Casey has released to the public domain from [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org).  Other than the `LICENSE.md` and `README.md` files, the code won't differ from what Casey releases.

I will try to keep this branch updated as long as I continue to have Casey's permission.

##  Message from Casey

   This program is totally hacky.  Don't expect it to work particularly well
   without a fair bit of care and attention.

   It's also super sloppy, like you pass printf arguments in from the settings
   file right now.  So DON'T EXPECT A WELL WRITTEN PROGRAM.  This is not one
   of those.  This is the opposite of that.

   YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

   - The Management
